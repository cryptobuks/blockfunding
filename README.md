# blockfunding  
Blockfunding is a yet, another decentralized crowdfunding platform. It's build entirely on the blockchain. Its' main backbone is two ethereum (solidity) contracts that manage the entire backend. The front-end is React, and setup is a one-click-deploy.  

## tests  
```
npm run compile
npm run test
```  
**Note:** you need to compile contracts before testing, that's what the first line is for
